## Previous Install

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```


generate in your repo  `jekyll new .`  (your current dir should be empty)

live reload `bundle exec jekyll serve -l`

then push it into github.

## Update

I am using leap-day theme, before running `undle exec jekyll serve` should update dependencies first.
```
bundle update
```
you will see a lots of themes installed.

### About Github blog.

Github would build automaitically after this repo was updated.

So, there is no need add _site into repo.

### About Source.

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/51240503

If your repo name is YOUR_GITHUB_NAME.gtihub.io, you can not set source to docs or gh-pages, `master` is the only option.
