# Xcode

Now I'm using Xcode as my C++ IDE.

## set more header path.

IDE would search this path for header files.

Add more path to header search path.

PS: You should set both TARGET and PROJECT.

Compiling and Linking would read TAEGET settings. PROJECT settings would help when coding and jumping source.

## Add library search path.
The path contains dylib files.

## Other linking

You can add multi linkers by adding once, just click + and input these

```
-I/usr/local/Cellar/opencv@2/2.4.13.7_7/include/opencv -I/usr/local/Cellar/opencv@2/2.4.13.7_7/include -L/usr/local/Cellar/opencv@2/2.4.13.7_7/lib -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_core -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_flann -lopencv_gpu -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_ml -lopencv_nonfree -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_ocl -lopencv_photo -lopencv_stitching -lopencv_superres -lopencv_ts -lopencv_video -lopencv_videostab


```
- -I means path contains header file.
- -L means path contains lib file.
- -l means which lib you need. (remove lib prefix and dylib extension)

And if you add lib in other linker flags, then no need to set in `library search path`
